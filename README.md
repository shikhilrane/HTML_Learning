# HTML_Learning

> Learning / practice repository for HTML concepts and small projects.

## About
This repository contains a set of small HTML learning exercises and mini-projects covering Emmet, tables, forms, media, head/meta usage, and a couple of small projects (resume & product catalog). The repository is intended as a hands-on collection of examples for learning HTML basics and common patterns.

> NOTE: folder & file listing was read from the repository index. If you'd like, I can update descriptions to match exact file contents after you paste any files or allow me to fetch raw files. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}
