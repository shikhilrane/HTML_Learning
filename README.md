# HTML_Learning

> Learning / practice repository for HTML concepts and small projects.

## About
This repository contains a set of small HTML learning exercises and mini-projects covering Emmet, tables, forms, media, head/meta usage, and a couple of small projects (resume & product catalog). The repository is intended as a hands-on collection of examples for learning HTML basics and common patterns.
